## NEET Testline Assignment

Provided with 3 different JSON APIs for Reteriving the data
 
- [Quiz API](https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/LLQT)
- [Response API](https://api.jsonserve.com/rJvd7g)
- [Historical Data](https://api.jsonserve.com/XgAgFJ)

### Exploring the data
The first step is to understand the response generated by the given API.
First I am starting understanding the [QuizAPI](QuizAPI.ipynb) response

Then Making a dataFrame of the qustions present in the response so that we can use the features of Pandas for analyisng the data

Merged all the options with the question in a splitted format so that all the information which is present can be accessed and utilized at a single go.

Selecting the required cols for the analysis purpose and ignoring the extra columns. 

After this process we have the required data for the quiz that can be analysed and insights can be generated from the data.
